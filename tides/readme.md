# Tide 

## Tide is VPython based program

In the file, earthMoonSunDistance, it calculates the distance from Earth to moon and Sun in relation with tide of ocean.


The moon's gravity pulls at the Earth, causing predictable rises and falls in sea levels known as tides. 

High tides are when water bulges upward, and low tides are when water drops down.
 High tide results on the side of the Earth nearest the moon due to gravity, and it also happens on the side farthest from the moon due to the inertia of water.
 Low tides occur between these two humps.
